The Pioneers features a swift and marvelous character who has landed themself in a Catan-like world. 
The player will need to explore the map and collect resources in order to escape the dirty robber who wants all the resources for himself. 
The player will want to strategize the quickest and most profitable path in order to thwart the robberâ€™s plans. 
The player will then go up to a resource and quickly roll to determine how many resources they will obtain; however, the robber is lurking! 
Whenever the player rolls, the robber will also be scavenging for some resources himself! 
If the player manages to obtain 10 of each resource before the robber does, the player will escape the robber. 
If the player is slaking however, the robber may get lucky and obtain 10 of each resource himself! 
If this happens, the player will lose the game and be stuck on the island forever while the robber sails away! 
If the player and the robber both obtain 10 of each resource on the same roll, 
the game will end in a tie and both the player and the robber will be able to escape the island.
